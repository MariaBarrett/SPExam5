=====================================

HOW TO RUN
-------------------------------------
This program requires the TnT-tagger
by Thorsten Brants to run.

It assumes the tagger is added as an
enviromental variable / alias, so 
that the tagger can be run like any
other terminal command, i.e. 
tnt <lexfile> <123file> <tobetagged>
